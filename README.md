# Dessert_Receipe

This project is an iOS application built using **SwiftUI** and **MVVM** architecture. It integrates **async/await** for managing concurrency tasks and includes robust **error handling**. Additionally, **unit tests** are written to ensure the reliability of the core logic and ViewModels.

## Features

- **SwiftUI **: The app's user interface is fully built using SwiftUI, allowing for a smooth and modern user experience.
- **MVVM Architecture**: The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel pattern to separate UI and business logic, making the codebase more maintainable.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Utilizes `async/await` for efficient handling of concurrency tasks, enhancing app responsiveness.
- **Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error handling to manage potential issues gracefully.
- **Unit Testing**: Unit tests are included to verify the functionality of ViewModels and other core components, ensuring code reliability.
